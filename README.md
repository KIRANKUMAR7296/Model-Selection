### Choosing the Right Model for our Data Set is very Impportant Task, We Try Different Models for Different types of Data Sets.

### Finding the Right Estimator to get More Accuracy, there is a Scikit Learn Cheat Sheet Map which can help us to get better Accuracy.

### Try Different Data Sets and Follow the Path of the Scikit Learn Algorithm Map.

### I have even Added Simple Explanations so that the New Learners can Undersrtand Easily the Flow of Creating a Machine Learning Model.

### Even Accuracy can be Improved further with the Help of Increasing the Number of Estimators or by Finding the Best Estimators using Cross Fold Validations or any Ensemble Random Forest Regressor or Classifier.

### Here you will Find the Solution for Regression and Classification through a Simple Example of Boston Data Set and Heart Disease Data Set.
